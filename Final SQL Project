# Final SQL Project for Data Analytics Program with Charlotte Chaze
## For this SQL project, I analyzed a dataset called "chinook," which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.
## Using this dataset in SQLiteStudio (3.3.3), I answered multiple questions using the following written SQL queries.

/* 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. */
SELECT CustomerId, Firstname, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

/* 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil */
SELECT CustomerId, Firstname, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

/* 3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country. */
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, invo.InvoiceId, invo.InvoiceDate, invo.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices invo
ON cust.CustomerId = invo.CustomerId
WHERE cust.Country = 'Brazil'

/* 4. Show Employees who are Sales Agents */
SELECT EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales% %Agent%';

/* 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table. */
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices;

/* 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name. */
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.customerId = cust.CustomerId;

/* 7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers. */
SELECT cust.FirstName AS cust_FirstName, Cust.LastName AS cust_LastName, cust.Country, emp.LastName AS emp_LastName, emp.FirstName AS emp_FirstName, inv.Total
FROM employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.customerId = cust.CustomerId;

/* 8. How many invoices were there in 2009? */
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

/* 9. What are the total sales for 2009? */
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

/* 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name (tracks.Name) with each invoice line item (invoice_items.InvoiceLineId). */
SELECT tracks.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM tracks
JOIN invoice_items inv ON inv.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;

/* 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item. */
SELECT t.Name, t.Composer, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM Invoice_items i 
JOIN Tracks t ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

/* 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre. */
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN media_types m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

/* 13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent. */
SELECT * FROM employees;

SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS Total_Sales, e.LastName, e.FirstName
FROM employees e
JOIN customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

/* 14. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009? */
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS Total_Sales, e.LastName, e.FirstName
FROM employees e
JOIN customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%' AND e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) DESC
LIMIT 1;

# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
# I'm using a database called BIT_DB that contains 6 tables, customers tbles and January to May sales tables.

# Let's understand our data.
# customers has two columns, order_id and acctnum
# JanSales, FebSales, MarSales, AprSales, MaySales have orderId, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, and location

# 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT FebSales.orderID, customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderId = customers.order_id;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT orderId, Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

or

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (

SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS count_customer, AVG(quantity) * price AS average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2;
